                             <p> Climate change alters our environment by shifting weather conditions, rising sea levels, increases flood risks and threatens food production. This results into increased stress to our society, economy and environment (United-Nations). Shoukri and Zachariadis, 2012, stressed that Mediterranean Europe is expected to experience the most adverse climate change effects compared to other EU regions. According to MODIS data, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) of Cyprus has been increased from 2011 to 2017. Further, Cleland et al, 2017 showed that climate change confers shifts to plants blooming time. The question is: does LST relates to forest decline and does blooming timing of Cypriot forests have been altered over the years due to climate change? The overarching aim of this project is to research the impact of LST on Cypriot forests by anaysing time-series of SAR and thermal data. Impacts may include forest decline that does not relate to fire events, decreased forest density (e.g. biomass and leaf area index) and alternations to timing of forest blooming initiation, duration and termination. This project also analyses the understanding of the public sector about climate change and forest threats using questionnaires and relates the statistical results of the questionnaires to the output of the research. The results of the project could be used as scientific evidence for promoting environmentally friendly policies aiming to mitigate the effects of climate change, preserve a healthy ecosystem and consequently maintain social stability and stimulate economic growth. </p>

                             <p>The “FOREST” action is an individual fellowship for Dr Milto Miltiadou that aims to advance algorithms using emerging technologies related to full-waveform LiDAR, while assisting a young researcher to further improve her intellectual, transferable and scientific skills related to earth observation and environmental sciences, as well as give direct experience in participating in proposals. This action explores analysis and data understanding of full-waveform LiDAR, as well as fusion with other Earth Observation data for forestry applications. It advances and evaluates algorithms, which will be added to DASOS for reaching end users and stakeholders. This action further disseminates the results for raising awareness about the new algorithms and tools, increasing this way the usage of full-waveform LiDAR in remote forest surveying. It also makes link with the industry by exchanging knowledge between partners. </p>

                             <p>Full-waveform (FW) LiDAR is a particularly useful source of information in forestry since it samples data between tree branches, but compared to discrete LiDAR, there are very few researchers exploiting this due to the increased complexity. DASOS, an open source program, was developed, along with this thesis, to improve the adoption of FW LiDAR. DASOS uses voxelisation for interpreting the data and this approach is fundamentally different from state-of-art tools. There are three key features of DASOS, reflecting the key contributions of this thesis: Firstly, visualisation of a forest to improve field work planning. Polygonal meshes are generated using DASOS, by extracting an iso-surface from the voxelised data. Additionally, six data structures are tested for optimising iso-surface extraction. The new structure, `Integral Volumes', is the fastest but the best choice depends on the size of the data. Secondly, the FW LiDAR data are efficiently aligned with hyperspectral imagery using a geo-spatial representation stored within a hashed table with buckets of points. The outputs of DASOS are coloured polygonal meshes, which improves the visual output, and aligned metrics from the FW LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery. The metrics are used for generating tree coverage maps and it is demonstrated that the increased amount of information improves classification. The last feature is the extraction of feature vectors that characterise objects, such as trees, in 3D. This is used for detecting dead standing Eucalypt trees in a native Australian forest for managing biodiversity without tree delineation. A random forest classifier, a weighted-distance KNN algorithm and a seed growth algorithm are used to predict positions of dead trees. Improvements in the results from increasing numbers of training samples was prevented due to the noise in the field data. It is nevertheless demonstrated that forest health assessment without tree delineation is possible. Cleaner training samples that are adjustable to tree heights would have improved prediction. </p>
