                             <p> Climate change alters our environment by shifting weather conditions, rising sea levels, increases flood risks and threatens food production. This results into increased stress to our society, economy and environment (United-Nations). Shoukri and Zachariadis, 2012, stressed that Mediterranean Europe is expected to experience the most adverse climate change effects compared to other EU regions. According to MODIS data, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) of Cyprus has been increased from 2011 to 2017. Further, Cleland et al, 2017 showed that climate change confers shifts to plants blooming time. The question is: does LST relates to forest decline and does blooming timing of Cypriot forests have been altered over the years due to climate change? During this project we research the impact of LST on Cypriot forests by anaysing time-series of SAR and thermal data (paper: <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/4/1010" > https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/4/1010</a>). I also identified pest attacks, the most important months for observing the strength of the act of pityocampa (that annually eats the needles of pines) and how alternations to timing of forest blooming alters in relation to weather phenomena (paper under review – I am first author). We also processed chlorophyl data and I noticed that the peak of chlorophyll happens simultaneously with lower forest density identified by SAR. During that time, the lower canopy of the forest is blossoming, and the needles of the pines are being regenerated but the act of pityocampa is at its maximum resulting into lower forest density (work to be published). In this project we also disseminated questionnaires about “Climate change and Forest threads” and I analysed them. We found a positive correlation between being employed and beliefs aligned with climate changes and showed that people can notice climate change related phenomena, while this was not possible according to the literature 10 years ago (paper:  <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/12/9/1152" > https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/12/9/1152</a>) . There are prospects of combining my experience of LiDAR and adding on that project, as well as collaborating with social science to further research the demographic relation in beliefs and consequences of climate change.  </p>

                             <p>The “FOREST” action is an individual fellowship aiming to advance algorithms using emerging technologies related to full-waveform LiDAR. In parallel, it assisted myself, as young researcher, to further improve my intellectual, transferable, and scientific skills related to earth observation and machine learning, as well as proposal writing. This action explored analysis and data understanding of full-waveform LiDAR, as well as fusion with other Earth Observation data for forestry applications. It added on my EngD and improved detecting of dead standing Eucalypt trees in Australia. It implemented multi-scale 3D-windows for extracting structural elements to tackle the issue of tree height differences in native forests and improved classification results (paper available here: <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/2/161" > https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/2/161</a>). It further improved the voxelisation approach by accounting occlusions and the time traveling of signal between the plane and the target (more data were required for evaluation, data are now available through collaboration with Sao Paulo State University, Brazil). The user-guide of the open-source software DASOS was update, support for new file formats was added and a paper describing all its functionalities was published (paper: <a href=" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334069759_Open_source_software_DASOS_efficient_accumulation_analysis_and_visualisation_of_full-waveform_lidar" > https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334069759_Open_source_software_DASOS_efficient_accumulation_analysis_and_visualisation_of_full-waveform_lidar</a>). It worth noting that my open-source software DASOS has been selected for inclusion in the Artic code Vault Contributor of 2020 Github Archive Program. </p>

                             <p>Full-waveform (FW) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) – 3D laser scanning data, usually acquired from aircrafts - is a particularly useful source of information in forestry since it samples data between tree branches, but compared to discrete LiDAR, there are very few researchers exploiting this due to the increased complexity. DASOS, an open source program, was developed, along with this thesis, to improve the adoption of FW LiDAR (DASOS available at: <a href="https://github.com/Art-n-MathS/DASOS" > https://github.com/Art-n-MathS/DASOS </a>). DASOS uses voxelisation for interpreting the data and this approach is fundamentally different from state-of-art tools. There are three key features of DASOS, reflecting the key contributions of this thesis: Firstly, visualisation of a forest to improve field work planning. Polygonal meshes are generated using DASOS, by extracting an iso-surface from the voxelised data. Additionally, six data structures are tested for optimising iso-surface extraction. The newly proposed data structure, `Integral Volumes', is the fastest but the best choice depends on the size of the data (paper: <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/4/559" > https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/4/559 </a>). Secondly, the FW LiDAR data are efficiently aligned with hyperspectral imagery using a geo-spatial representation stored within a hashed table with buckets of points. The outputs of DASOS are coloured polygonal meshes, which improves the visual output, and aligned metrics from the FW LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery. The metrics are used for generating tree coverage maps and it is demonstrated that the increased amount of information improves classification (paper: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-1257-2015" > http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-1257-2015 </a>). The last feature is the extraction of feature vectors that characterise objects, such as trees, in 3D. This is used for detecting dead standing Eucalypt trees in a native Australian forest for managing biodiversity without tree delineation. A random forest classifier, a weighted-distance KNN algorithm and a seed growth algorithm are used to predict positions of dead trees. Improvements in the results from increasing numbers of training samples was prevented due to the noise in the field data. It is nevertheless demonstrated that forest health assessment without tree delineation is possible. Cleaner training samples would have improved prediction (paper: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243418300485" > https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243418300485 </a>). </p>
